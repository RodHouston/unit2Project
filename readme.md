This is my atemp at a social app for my motorcycle group called The Cyclepaths. It is a basic application at the moment. However, i do plane to develop it further. 
The app features a profile page with user content, a wall page that displays all users content. The user is able to upload pictures via url. 
The main struggles I hade were in file uploading for photos. I workded on this feature 80% of the time only for it to fail. Resulting in me only being able to
use loaded photos from outher sites. The main feature was supposed to allowing the user to share their favorite riding routes and stories. This took back seat 
to the photo upload problem. In the futures I will focus on the map feature. Styling was rushed also du to me fighting the upload feature.
